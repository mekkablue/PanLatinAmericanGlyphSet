# Pan-Latin American Glyph Set

Pan-Latin American Glyph Set for Typefaces: a collection of diacritics for supporting languages

The data collected here is primarily compiled for use in the font editor Glyphs.app, and glyph names adhere to the ‘nice names’ scheme according to the open-sourced GlyphData.xml.

## Language Support

This project is about collecting Latin diacritics necessary for supporting languages in Latin America. Its main purpose is to enable type designers and font engineers to produce fonts that support the languages of Latin America.

* Basic Latin (a-z, A-Z) is ignored
* must be technically possible to support (supported in Unicode)
* must be economically viable to support (vital languages, see criteria support below)

### Majority Language Support

A list of diacritics for support of the major languages spoken in Latin America including the Caribbean. Will be incorporated into Glyphs.app as ‘Latin American’.

* Spanish
* Portuguese
* French
* Haitian Creole (hat): 11m+ speakers
* Quechua (que): 7.7m+ speakers
* Guaraní (grn): 6.0m+ speakers
* Náhuatl (nhn): 1.7m+ speakers
* Aymara (aym): 1.6m+ speakers
* Maya (yua): 800k+ speaker
* Mapudungun (arn): 250k+ speakers

Are there more languages to add? We can add a language if it meets most or all of the following criteria:

* must be codified in Latin
* with an institutionalised orthography
* 100k+ speakers
* in institutional use (EGIDS 0-4)
* status as official language

### Minority Language Support

A list of all diacritics and specific punctuation necessary for all codified languages of Latin America written with the Latin script, but not included in the above list. May be included as an additional sidebar entry in Glyphs.app (e.g., ‘Latin American Plus’). It must fulfil vitality criteria to be included:

* Is it codified and using the Latin script?
* Does it have an established orthography? (I.e., is its alphabetical spectrum clearly defined?)
* Is it recognized with an ISO language code?
* Is it in institutional use?
* Is there (be it preliminary) technical support for typing on desktop and mobile devices?
* Is it in actual contemporary use? (I.e. is there need for font and keyboard support?)

If possible, apply the EGIDS system in a sensible way.

### Endangered and Extinct Language Support

Optional step for the future, for all the languages that do not fulfil the above criteria.

* Latin script (be it only as transcription)
* Established orthography with a clearly defined alphabetical spectrum
